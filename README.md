# IBM Open Science Prize 2021

The task of the [IBM Open Science Prize 2021](https://ibmquantumawards.bemyapp.com/#/event) was to simulate a Heisenberg model Hamiltonian for three interacting atoms on IBM Quantum's 7-qubit Jakarta system. The goal was to simulate the evolution of a known quantum state with the best fidelity as possible using Trotterization.
